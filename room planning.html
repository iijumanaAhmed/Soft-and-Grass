 Today, space planning is no more restricted to residential spaces, but has floated to commercial projects too.
An ideal space is
one that can accommodate everything as well as give you the desired comfort. For example, if a living
room is arranged with
bulky furniture which leaves no room to accommodate anything else, then the whole idea about

With a cluttered space like this, you will constantly feel claustrophobic.
 Here are reasons why space planning is important in interior designing:

When it comes to space planning, you first need to consider the purpose of the room. Earlier, specific rooms were assigned for specific purposes. But today with the changing trend a room can be multifunctional too. For example, a kitchen is designed in
<br>
such a way that it is not only a work area but can accommodate dining space. Similarly, you can extend your bedroom to make enough space for a dressing room.

Space planning involves complete floor mapping. With a clear floor plan, you will be able to gauge the space. This will help
<br>
you to select the right furniture based on the size of the room. It will also give you an idea of how and where to place the furniture.

Ideal space planning can bring in a sense of balance between beauty and comfort. Be it the space of your kitchen or bedroom, every area counts. A space must have a good sense of balance. This comes when you are able to integrate everything well. Colour, design, placement, interior accessories, etc. are all responsible in creating the perfect balance.

A space should be designed or planned in such a way that it should be visually appealing. Say for example, the first time you visit a restaurant, your reaction is either good or bad. Similarly, space planning plays an important role when it comes to visualization.
<br>
With a given space, how well you can place objects is instrumental.
