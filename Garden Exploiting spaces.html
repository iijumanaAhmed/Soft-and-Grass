<p> In this example, a modest home is brightened with a small garden built into the driveway retaining wall, entirely in scale with the home itself. A mass of rudbeckia, a few coneflowers, a morning glory vine climbing the lamp post, and some whimsical figures combine to create a personal touch. This is a very small front yard and it could easily be lost among the other yew-framed houses lining the street.
But these homeowners enjoy a cheerful burst of color, every time they turn into their driveway. In a small garden such as this one, long-blooming perennials are the key to lasting interest.
This small square garden is the first thing you notice about the house and, simple as it may be, it makes passers-by notice and smile. It is not a grand garden, but it is still somehow commanding.

<p> Here, too, the gardener has used wasted space next to the driveway to create a welcome-home garden. The plants are easy-to-grow workhorses: coneflower, sedum, daylilies, and flowering shrubs. But here the space has expanded and seems to be expanding still, winding
its way around to the roadside. Gardens this free-flowing are unusual in American front yards, yet it doesn't seem out of place in this example. Areas along driveways and streets are often the best locations for garden planting areas in the front yards of smaller homes.
