Simplicity. If you were looking for a word that described what modern home decor was then that would be; it is simplicity. Of course, 
<br> simple doesn’t mean boring and modern decor with its clean lines, neutral color palette and geometric shapes is anything but boring. 
<br> Instead, modern home decor can be warm, inviting and completely stylish in just about any home. But how do you achieve modern home 
<br> decor? Obviously, it isn’t as simple as walking into a store and choosing items that have clean lines. There takes a bit more to that and there 
<br> are several basic ideas that should be incorporated into a modern decor.

<b><u> Pick an Appropriate Theme: </u></b></font><br><br>

Before you start looking for specific pieces of furniture, the first thing you should do is pick an appropriate theme. Instead of approaching 
<br> each individual room in your home separately, you should pick a design style and apply it to every room in the house to create a cohesive 
<br> design. By choosing a theme, you make it that much easier for yourself to choose furniture that compliments each other. You need to make 
<br> sure that every piece of furniture in your home complements each other, and picking a central theme is the easiest way to do that.
<br> There are a variety of design styles you can choose from. For example, a contemporary theme includes pieces of furniture that are metallic 
<br> and angular. On the other hand, a casual style will include pieces of furniture that give off a cozy and naturalistic feel with simple 
<br> accessories incorporated. Whichever style aesthetic you choose is up to you but making sure that your space is consistent between rooms 
<br> is important as it makes it easier for you to choose pieces that complement each other.

<b><u> Pay Attention to Textiles and Textures: </u></b></font>

After you have picked an overarching design style and begin shopping for furniture, the next thing you should consider is what each piece 
<br> of furniture is made out of. The textiles and textures of a sofa, chair or bedroom set are an extremely important factor that every homeowner 
<br> should consider. This is because certain textiles and textures last longer than others. For example, furniture made out of nylon, olefin, and 
<br> polyester tends to last longer than furniture made out of cotton, linen, and wool. Purchasing furniture that will last as long as possible should 
<br> be your number one priority when choosing furniture, given how expensive some pieces can be. The textiles and textures are a great 
<br> indicator of how long your furniture will last

<b><u> Consider the Layout of Each Room: </u></b></font>
<br><br>

The third and final factor to consider is the layout of each room. The dimensions, lighting, interior design, and spacing of each room are 
<br> extremely important to keep in mind. For example, it would make little sense to purchase large furniture for a small room or small 
<br> furniture for a large room. You want to make sure that the size of the furniture fits within the dimensions of the room that you are putting it in. 
<br> Additionally, try to make sure that the pieces of furniture purchased can fit together without being overcrowded. While price and design 
<br> are important factors when furnishing a home, there are other important factors that need to be considered as well. You should also be 
<br> considering what the furniture is made out of, whether or not it compliments other pieces in your home, and if it fits within the dimensions 
<br> of the space you are trying to create. As long as you keep these three factors in mind the next time you furnish a new home or redecorate 
<br> your current space, you will end up creating the perfect home.
