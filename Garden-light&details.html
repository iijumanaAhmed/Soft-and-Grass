Add some sparkle to your home, inside and out, with a set of unique fairy light designs. Fairy lights bring a magical quality to any garden, and these flower versions work beautifully with the lace tablecloth and pressed-glass tealight
 holders. A little light goes a long way at night. Use lighting selectively and remember that darkness can be used to conceal areas.

Decorative metal lanterns are going from strength to strength as the must-have modern room accessory.

Remember their origins as the earliest way of lighting up Victorian streets and herald them as the perfect
indoor/outdoor accessory. The sheer joy of these contemporary beauties comes from the colour choices and shapes – there is one to suit every garden and every design personality.

If you are fortunate enough to have a garden in full bloom, light up your flora and fauna with lanterns. Especially now, with LED battery-powered candles at their most efficient and cost-effective, you can avoid any risks involved with real candles while still providing a striking glow. The gentle pinks and red
of these silk and paper lanterns are just perfect for enhancing the natural palette of the rhododendrons. Just beautiful.

Perfect for marking a special occasion, LED-lit trees add a decorative and atmospheric touch to gardens. The bulbs in these designs have been altered to create a warmer colour that is much more inviting than the typical blue-hued glow, creating a magical, twinkling effect ideal for lighting up walkways and garden paths.
