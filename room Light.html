 When thinking about the flow of space, ambience and atmosphere in your home, lighting can be one of the most fundamental elements. 
<br> Brighter lights can make you feel alert and awake, whereas dimmer, softer lights can be relaxing and sleep-inducing. Also adding few 
<br> details as frames or flowers vase can make big change in the room. Almost every room can benefit from applying a few interior design 
<br> lighting tips.

If you're starting from scratch or redecorating a room, create a mini brief or lighting plan that tackles the essentials. Think about what 
<br> activities take place in each room (eating, relaxing, working), key features of a room you want to highlight and what architectural 
<br> boundaries you may need to take into account. Consider style, scale, output and even colour temperature of lights before you go rushing into 
<br> design decisions. Early planning makes for less headaches and rushed last minute decisions.</font>

Take a layered approach to lighting with different light sources across different levels to create ambience and interest in a room. Use 
<br> lighting to make the most of a room's size and shape –uplighting makes a room feel larger, low hung pendants will create an illusion of 
<br> height and clusters of lighting make large rooms seem cosier.

Consider what tasks you may be undertaking in each room where lighting can affect or aid you. Cooking requires more concentrated 
<br> lighting, therefore a combination of bright downlights and recess lighting, in cabinets and above stove tops, is useful. For reading, flexible 
<br> and directional lighting aimed away from you is better. Powder rooms require a combination of sidelights and downlights. Dimmers will 
<br> quickly become your new best friend, providing an energy efficient and effective way to quickly change the atmosphere and warmth of a 
<br> room.
